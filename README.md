# Optimizing Mountain Array Formation Using Longest Increasing and Decreasing Subsequences

- ### Intuition
    The goal is to transform the given array into a "mountain array" with minimal element removals. A valid mountain array has:
    1. A strictly increasing sequence up to a peak.
    2. A strictly decreasing sequence after the peak.

    To achieve this, each element in the array needs to be part of both an increasing and decreasing subsequence. This problem essentially reduces to finding the **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)** up to each element and the **Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS)** from each element. By determining where these two subsequences overlap, we can calculate the minimum number of removals needed to make a mountain array.

- ### Approach
    1. **Compute LIS Array**:
        - Use a helper function to find the length of the LIS ending at each index. This will be stored in an array `LIS`, where `LIS[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence up to `nums[i]`.

    2. **Compute LDS Array**:
        - Similarly, use another helper function to calculate the length of the LDS starting from each index. This will be stored in an array `LDS`, where `LDS[i]` represents the length of the longest decreasing subsequence starting from `nums[i]`.

    3. **Determine Valid Peaks**:
        - Loop through each element except the first and last. For an element to be a valid peak in the mountain array, both `LIS[i]` and `LDS[i]` should be greater than 1.
        - For each valid peak, calculate the number of elements that would need to be removed on both sides to form a mountain array with this peak. The formula for removals is:
            - **Left side removals** = `(index) - (LIS[index] - 1)`
            - **Right side removals** = `(length of array - index - 1) - (LDS[index] - 1)`
        - Keep track of the minimum removals needed across all valid peaks.

    4. **Return Minimum Removals**:
        - The minimum value calculated from the above steps represents the minimum elements to remove to achieve a mountain array structure.

- ### Time Complexity
    - Calculating the **LIS** and **LDS** for all elements requires **O(nÂ²)** each, where `n` is the length of `nums`, due to the nested loops in each helper function.
    - Iterating through the array to find valid peaks and calculate removals is **O(n)**.
    
    Thus, the overall time complexity is:
    \[
    O(n<sup>2</sup>) + O(n) = O(n<sup>2</sup>)
    \]

- ### Space Complexity
    - The `LIS` and `LDS` arrays both require **O(n)** space to store the subsequence lengths.
    - Additional variables use only constant space.

    Therefore, the space complexity is:
    \[
    O(n)
    \]
